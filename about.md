Hello and welcome! My name is Adam, and I have an avid passion for anything and
everything involving computers. My main focus is low-level software engineering
and cybersecurity, and I'm a strong advocate for the [Rust programming
language][rust] as a safe and modern choice for systems programming.

This website is my personal blog where I post updates about my personal
projects and share my broader experiences as a software developer and hacker.

If you're looking for my online portfolio, it is still a work-in-progress, but
feel free to browse my [GitHub profile][github] in the meantime.
