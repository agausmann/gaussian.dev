    <p>I think this marks the third or fourth time that I’ve tried to start a blog.
My previous attempts never got anywhere because I never decided to sit down and
write about anything I was doing.  More often than not, I had a project idea
that I would work on for a few weeks, and either I got stuck and burned out or
I got bored and moved on.  However, lately I’ve found some projects that I
seriously enjoy working on, and with them comes a lot of new experiences that I
want to share with others.</p>

<p>At the moment, that sharing happens with my friends in private or semi-private
chat groups.  (I say semi-private because some of the groups are technically
“public,” but in practice the audience is limited based around whatever
specific common interest that chat group was created for.)  With that in mind,
the idea for this blog is, whenever I have such a project that I want to share
with others, instead of directing it only to smaller groups, I can write about
them here for the general public to enjoy.  I don’t plan on following any fixed
post schedule, but I will generally aim to post every one to two months with
the details of a recent adventure of mine.</p>

<p>So, welcome! I’m excited to have you all along for the ride.  My first real
post will hopefully be published sometime in June or July.  It will be about my
current project, a novel library for PC keyboard firmwares, written in the
<a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust programming language</a>.  I can’t wait to share it with you all!</p>
